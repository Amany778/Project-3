G12_Project_3

Our project's purpose is to build on our previous work and use Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis to demonstrate that our renewable energy portfolio is a good investment for environmentally conscious and socially responsible investors. This project utilized a recurrent neural network and lstm model to anaylze the projection of the green portofolio prices and if they would provide a positive outcome. As a comparison we use NLP sentiment anaylsis to further illustrate these renewable energy stocks are a great investment. Once we have gathered our data we will create a user friendly interactive dashboard where investors can view our findings. Our hope is that with the knowledge provided the investors will make a more informed decision to enthusatically invest in these companies which will provide positive reutrns. 

The following provides a brief description of how we gathered the data and developed our code, followed by our findings after analysing the data. Finally, we use Streamlit (https://albakomito-g12-project-2-streamlitapp-sdqrij.streamlitapp.com/) as a frontend development tool to display our result in a user friendly UI.
