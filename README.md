# Group 12: Project 3
## Machine Learning, NLP & Fundamental Ratios: Is now a good time to buy Renewable Energy Stocks?  

Our project's purpose is to build on our previous work and use Classification and Sentiment Analysis to demonstrate that our renewable energy portfolio is a good investment for environmentally conscious and socially responsible investors. This project utilized a recurrent neural network to anaylze the projection of the green portofolio prices and if they would provide a positive outcome. As a comparison we use NLP sentiment anaylsis to further illustrate these renewable energy stocks are a great investment. Once we have gathered our data we will create a user friendly interactive dashboard where investors can view our findings. Our hope is that with the knowledge provided the investors will make a more informed decision to enthusatically invest in these companies which will provide positive reutrns. 

The following provides a brief description of how we gathered the data and developed our code, followed by our findings after analysing the data. Finally, we use Streamlit () as a frontend development tool to display our result in a user friendly UI.
